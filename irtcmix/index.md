# iRTcmix

iRTcmix enables iOS developers to easily incorporate interactive sound
into their iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch apps. The library includes the
compiled RTcmix object and Objective-C classes for communicating with
the RTcmix audio engine and for interacting with Minc scores. iRTcmix
greatly simplifies the process of adding audio to iOS apps; start making
noise with just a few lines of code\! The library and demo projects are
available at GitHub:

## Apps Made with iRTcmix

**iLooch**  
by Brad Garton

iLooch is an iPhone/iPod-touch application designed to generate evolving
ambient sounds. The music is not "sampled"; it is instead created by
generative and algorithmic rule-sets coupled with various synthesis
techniques. They'll go on forever and ever\! (well, at least for a few
hours...) Because the music is being constructed on-the-fly, each time
it plays it will be slightly different. Such is life.

**iMonkeypants**  
by Ryan Carter

iMonkeypants is an album of algorithmically generated,
listener-interactive electronica in the form of an iPhone app. The music
responds in real time to the position of the device, giving the listener
control over certain aspects of the sound while it plays.
