**setup\_rtcmixrc** - build a *.rtcmixrc* option file

-----

### Synopsis

**setup\_rtcmixrc**

-----

### Description

The **setup\_rtcmixrc** utility will create a file *.rtcmixrc* in your
home directory that will contain options for running RTcmix. This file
is, actually, optional itself. BUT if you want to specify all sorts of
fanciness for your particular configuration, this may be the Ideal
Command for *YOU\!*.

The options will be read as if you created a bunch (gaggle?) of
[set\_option](../scorefile/set_option.html) scorefile commands, and you
can add or subtract options to the *.rtcmixrc* file accordingly.
**setup\_rtcmixrc** will use your default options to build the file.
Reassign, reconfigure and rearrange at your leisure.
