### F1/F2/I1/I2

*scripts to create floating-point and integer soundfiles*  
  
These are all older utilities to create soundfile (headers only) -- the
disk-based Cmix required soundfiles to pre-exist, at least in header
form, on disk for information about sampling rate, etc. The
[rtoutput](../scorefile/rtoutput.html) command does not have this
restriction.

all are shell scripts that bundle up options for the
[sfcreate](sfcreate.html) command, because we used to get tired of
typing all them numbers and letters back in the *Olden Days*

Here's what they are:

``` 

F1: sfcreate -r 44100 -c 1 -f -t sun $1
    (writes a 1-channel floating-point 44.1k soundfile header)
F2: sfcreate -r 44100 -c 2 -f -t sun $1
    (writes a 2-channel floating-point 44.1k soundfile header)
I1: sfcreate -r 44100 -c 1 -i $1
    (writes a 1-channel 16-bit integer 44.1k soundfile header)
I2: sfcreate -r 44100 -c 1 -i $1
    (writes a 2-channel 16-bit integer 44.1k soundfile header)
```

Pretty silly, huh?

Here's a *Handy Fact To Know* -- all of these scripts (and
[sfcreate](sfcreate.html) itself, of course) can write a new header onto
a pre-existing file without disturbing too much of the file's contents
(you may lose a few bytes at the front depending on the size of the
header and any pre-existing headers on the file). Ever wondered what
your executable <u>sounds</u> like?
