## system

Perform any system call.

-----

### Synopsis

**system**(*"command\_line"*)

-----

### Description

This provides a way to do from an RTcmix script most anything you could
do from a UNIX shell. The directory in which the command will execute is
the directory in which RTcmix was invoked.

NOTE: This feature is disabled in [iRTcmix](../../iRTcmix/index.html)
because of restrictions on iOS apps placed by Apple.

-----

### Arguments

  - <span id="item_command_line">*"command\_line"*</span>  
      
    A double-quoted string giving unix shell command to perform.

-----

### RETURN VALUE

The return value of the shell command.

-----

### NOTES

The call is performed during the initialization portion of an RTcmix
script that contains calls to real-time instruments. That is, it happens
while RTcmix is parsing the script, but before it has run any of the
instruments called in the script. This means you can't use **system** to
operate on a sound file generated by instruments in the script,
because the file won't contain anything yet when **system** does its
work.

-----

### Examples

```cpp
   system("rm -f pvoctest.aif")
   system("ls -l *.aif")
```

This will remove the file "pvoctest.aif" and then list the contents of
the current working directory.
