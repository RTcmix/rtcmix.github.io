### bpluck

*some wort of weird Karplus-Strong variant*  
  
Jeez, I have no real clue what this code does. It looks like it's
missing a setup function, and no, it doesn't do a block-computing
version of [pluck](pluck.html). It probably dates back to the mid-1980's
(or earlier).

From the source code:

float bpluck(float xin, float \*q)
