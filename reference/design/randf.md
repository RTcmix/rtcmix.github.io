### randf

*1/f pseudo-random number generator?*  
  
This looks like it's trying to make some kind of 1/f noise (or
equivalent random-wolk thing), but I'll be blamed if I can say fer sure.

If I were you, I'd use the [Orand](Orand.html) object instead.

From the source code:

-----

float randf(float \*oldval, float factor)
