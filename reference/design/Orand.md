### Orand

*INSTRUMENT design -- pseudo-random number generator object*  
  
The **Orand** object can be used to generate streams of pseudo-random
numbers. The generating algorthm can be seeded by a particular seed
value or can be set by the system clock, thus creating a different
sequence of random numbers for every run of the algorithm.

It brings together and can be used to replace a number of older
pseudo-random number functions scattered throughout cmix/RTcmix,
including the [rrand,](rrand.html) [srrand,](rrand.html) and
[crandom](crandom.html) functions.

The pseudo-random number generator used in the RTcmix distribution isn't
the latest and greatest, but it seems to do the job well enough for us
flaky musicians.
